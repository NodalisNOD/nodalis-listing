# Sunday Cronos Pulse: Big Updates Across Crypto.com, Wolf Swap, Croc With Knife, and More!

**Date:** April 27, 2025  
**By:** Crypto Warehouse  

Welcome back, CRO Family, to your Sunday Cronos Pulse! I’m Mike from Crypto Warehouse, and today we dive into the biggest stories from across the Cronos Chain over the past week.

This week is packed with exciting updates, including:

- The Crypto.com and Trump Media partnership  
- The Loaded Lions Fractured Land Sale  
- Wolf Swap’s new trading season  
- Community spotlights on Croc With Knife, Pride, and Candy Tapper  
- A special announcement: Crypto Warehouse content will now also be featured on Nodalis!  

Let’s jump right in!

## Crypto.com x Trump Media: Promises Made, Promises Kept

Crypto.com and Trump Media have announced a collaboration to offer America First ETFs through Crypto.com.

While trading volumes are expected to be modest—these are not comparable to large Bitcoin ETFs like IBIT—the partnership is a major PR win for Crypto.com in the U.S. As Mike highlighted earlier this week:

> “This strengthens Crypto.com’s visibility and status in America, even if it won’t significantly impact the CRO price right away.”

This move also reflects a form of “payback” for the $1 million donation Fortis (affiliated with Crypto.com) made to Trump’s campaign.

## Wolf Swap: Season 12 Launches on April 28

Season 11 of Wolf Swap has wrapped up, and Season 12 is ready to launch on April 28! Participation is simple: just trade over at wolfswap.app.

Expect stunning visuals and new promotional events—Wolf Swap has put tremendous effort into creating an engaging experience. If you took part in Season 11, don’t forget to check if you’ve won any rewards!

## Loaded Lions: Fractured Land Sale + Airdrop Opportunity

Mark your calendars! The highly anticipated Fractured Land Sale for Loaded Lions is just days away.

Even better: if you hold land from this sale, you’ll be eligible for a Lion Token airdrop. So if you’re planning to participate, remember—land ownership comes with extra perks!

## Community Highlights: Croc With Knife, Pride, and Candy Tapper

**Croc With Knife**  
A meme project that doesn’t just deliver laughs—it also offers a polished website, active Discord and Telegram channels. Their memes are pure gold, and the Croc With Knife team knows how to keep the community entertained. Definitely worth a follow!

**Pride**  
Earlier this week, we reviewed Pride, their staking system, and their NFT project. We even gave away 300,000 Pride tokens! Stay tuned—something brewing involving Pride and VVS might surprise you next week...

**Candy Tapper (Candy City)**  
Candy City continues to grow with the release of their Telegram-based tapper game. Known for colorful graphics and a strong roadmap focused on Play-to-Earn games, Candy City is a longstanding community project worth supporting. Whether you’re on iPhone or Android, give their games a try and help strengthen the Cronos ecosystem!

## Crypto Warehouse Expands to Nodalis

Exciting news! Crypto Warehouse videos and articles will now also be published on Nodalis—bringing the latest Cronos news even closer to the community.

> “We are stronger together.”
