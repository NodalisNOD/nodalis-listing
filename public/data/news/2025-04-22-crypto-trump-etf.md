  # Crypto.com Strikes Deal with Trump Media for “Made in America” ETFs: What It Means for CRO

  **Date:** April 22, 2025

  On April 22, 2025, Crypto.com CEO Chris Marzalak announced a strategic partnership with Trump Media. The deal designates Crypto.com as the official custodian for the new “Made in America” ETFs—meaning the platform will manage and safeguard the underlying assets of these funds.

  ## Trump’s Crypto Push

  Donald Trump has made no secret of his ambition to dominate the crypto space. From launching *World Liberty Financial* to creating his own meme token, and now supporting a line of ETFs, this partnership reflects his continued expansion into digital finance.

  ## Political Ties and Payback

  Crypto.com, under the name Fortis, donated $1 million to Trump’s 2024 campaign—joining other major players like Coinbase, Circle, and Tether. This ETF arrangement could be seen as a form of political “payback” following their support. Chris Marzalak and Crypto.com were also present at the White House’s first crypto summit, and this move appears to further solidify their ties with Trump’s administration.

  ## The ETF Impact

  These ETFs aren’t expected to reach the scale of giants like BlackRock or ARK Invest. However, their “Made in America” label is likely to attract significant Republican-aligned investor interest. And with **CRO**, the native token of Crypto.com, expected to be included in the asset mix, the move could drive new demand and awareness for the token.

  ## CRO’s Moment?

  CRO has long struggled with price stagnation and oversupply. Although rewards from staking and cardholder incentives remain strong, buy pressure has been limited. Inclusion in a Trump-backed ETF could flip the script by introducing passive institutional accumulation.

  ## Price Expectations

  CRO supporters often hope for a return to its all-time high of $2.71. However, Crypto Warehouse suggests a more grounded target:  
  > “$0.60 would be a realistic end-of-bull-run price—about a 6× from where we are now.”

  ETF-driven buy pressure may help support this growth, but the full impact likely won’t materialize within this current market cycle.

  ## Timeline and Realistic Outlook

  Launching an ETF is a process—approval can take up to six months. That places a potential launch date around October 2025, leaving little room for major short-term price impact if the bull run ends before then.

  While the partnership is significant, it’s not yet transformational.  

  > “This is good news, but not great news,” Crypto Warehouse concludes. “It’s not handing over the keys to the ETF kingdom—it’s just opening the door.”
